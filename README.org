* Description
Adds support for the [[https://fennel-lang.org/][Fennel]] programming language.

Disclaimer: Still in progress. I am having mixed results with certain features
using the REPL such as the "Find definition of symbol" functionality.

** Features:
  - Syntax highlighting with =fennel-mode=
  - Interactive REPL
  - More to come...

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =fennel= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file. You will also need fennel installed in your path
([[https://fennel-lang.org/][see Fennel site]]).

This layer is currently set up to enable fennel-mode for any .fnl files.
